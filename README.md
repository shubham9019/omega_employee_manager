## Python Chat app

This a basic chat application implemented using Python 3 and the most basic libraries possible to make this app. This app has various functionality including adding username after connecting to a server. Server can be accessed by multiple computers on the same network. Chat experience is seamless even after multiple devices connected to the same server.

### Highlights of this app

**Socket Programming** - Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server.

**Multi-threading** - Running several threads is similar to running several different programs concurrently.

**Key Features**

 - Graphical User Interface(GUI)
 - Socket Programming
 - Multiple device connection
 - Minimalist UI

This feels great to be tested on multiple computers. You can, of course, run the server and the client on the same machine for testing (using `127.0.0.1` for `HOST` in your client), but seeing the communication happen in real-time among different computers feels awesome. The server script will log which IP addresses are accessing it, and the client script will generate a GUI (after asking for the host address)
